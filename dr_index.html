            <h1>Perception of actresses in each century</h1>

            <p>Looking back through history, it can be easily argued that the role of the actress in society has gone through a notable evolution. 
                During the 16th Century, it was a rare occurrence for a woman to be seen on stage. Women’s roles were played by young boys. 
                It was not until the 17th Century that women first appeared on the English and Parisian stages. However, it was considered improper because women were expected to remain in the shadows, and actresses had to put themselves on display in order to work. 
                As the role of actresses evolved and they were seen more frequently on stage, society considered them to have bad morals and be prostitutes. 
                It was not until the late 19th Century that the view of an actress in society had reached a respectable level. This change was caused, in part, by Sarah Bernhardt. 
                Sarah Bernhardt’s fame and notoriety in film and on the French stage during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries made being an actress a respectable job for women in European society. </p>

<h2> Actresses before Burnhardt</h2>

<p>During the Elizabethan era in the 16th Century, it was commonplace for a young 
    apprentice boy to play a woman’s role on stage. Historian Lisa Jardine commented that this switching of gender roles was universal and was, therefore disregarded by the audience.  Women were not seen on the European stage during this time. However, in Southern France women were making strides and were seen on the French stage. “Southern France’s records [show] that in 1509 at Romans, a production of the mystery play ‘Le Mystère des Trois Doms’ designated all but one of the female roles to women,” historian Lesley Farris adds. “These women performers all came from the local nobility and, with two exceptions, were married.”  Women were also making strides in Italy with the Italian commedia dell’arte. The reason women were able to take part in this type of theatre was the fact that commedia dell’arte troupes were family based.  Husbands and wives worked together as teams. Not only were these women seen on stage, they were also praised for their work. “The commedia actresses often received high praise for their many talents – singing, dancing, playing guitar and bass-viol, and the writing of poetry.”</p>   
    <p>While it appears that actresses were making a mark on the European stages and gaining some respectability, actresses were never regularly employed. It was not until the 17th Century that women first appeared on the English and Parisian stages. The acceptance of women on stage was not due to the fact that society saw them as superior to boys. Historian Colley Cibber hypothesized that watching a woman play a woman’s role allowed theatre to evolve and become better.  Playwrights began writing women’s roles intending for women to play them, which added a depth not seen in theatre before.</p>
    <p>It was during the 17th Century that actresses began to be used mainly as sexual objects 
    whose sexuality was exploited on stage.  “Actresses were frequently required to do no more than 
    pose, like pictures or statues, to be gazed upon and desired by male characters in the play and, 
    presumably, by male spectators,” historian Elizabeth Howe observes.  In 17th Century plays, not only was sensuality often used, but also violence towards women was common. “Stabbing was very popular, offering as it did the striking image of a naked bosom spattered with blood.”  Violence on stage created sexual thrills for spectators. The 17th century gave actresses the reputation of being whores, which stayed with the profession for about another century.   
    It is widely known that European women in the 18th and early 19th Centuries had a specific place in society that did not allow them to do what men could. In his autobiography, actor Edward Carpenter remarked that “girls of whom I least expected it told me that their lives were miserable ‘with nothing on earth to do.’”  It was no wonder that women felt this way as they were expected to remain in the house and make sure the servants did what needed to be done. Women who did otherwise were considered “redundant.”  This was another reason as to why actresses of the time were looked down upon. However, one must not disregard the hurdles that actresses had overcome throughout the years prior to the 18th Century.  </p>
   <p> The late 17th Century introduced the idea of aristocratic libertinism, which can be defined as an activity in the high society of France in which individuals pursued the pleasures of the flesh- extramarital affairs and mistresses.  Theatre women began to take part in these practices around the 1670s and became known for their bad morals.  Actresses had advantages over high-born women in the game of aristocratic libertinism because they were seen as exotic to the men of the court and they were not married, nor were they expected to marry. Since actresses were desirable, they “[turned] the selling of [their bodies] to a refined art.”  While actresses of the time were known as slaves to their sexuality and many had worked as prostitutes before turning to acting, their participation in aristocratic libertinism can be seen as one way they gained respect in high society during that time.  </p>
    <p>The early 19th Century served as a period in which actresses began to make a positive 
    mark on the profession. They were earning wages (generally equal to men), actresses enjoyed 
    freedoms unknown to women in other professions, and they were in an occupation exclusively 
    for women, and therefore did not affect the wages of men, allowing them to keep their jobs. 
    Despite these advances, actresses still had to deal with working in a male-dominated society and 
    the fact that they were defying the cultural norms of women during that era. As historian Tracy Davis suggests, “Social respectability was merited as long as women met the views prescribed for their age and class, but actresses – virtually by definition – lived and worked beyond the boundaries of propriety. Victorians were deeply suspicious of women whose livelihood depended on skills of deception and dissembling, and the circumstances of actresses’ 
    worked belied any pretenses to sexual naïveté, middle-class immobility, or feeble brain 
    power.”  </p> 
   <p> While actresses were still looked down upon, they were making strides during the 
    Victorian era in advancing themselves professionally.  This can be attributed, in part, to the fame 
    and notoriety of the actress Sarah Bernhardt whose career led a revolt against Victorian 
    restrictions on women. Bernhardt glorified the profession of acting, making it seem as if it was 
    unattainable to the average person.
