            <p><h2>Early childhood</h2></p>
            <p>Bernhardt was born in Paris on October 23, 1844, to parents Edouard Bernhardt and Julie 
                Van Hard. Her parents were not married, which made her an illegitimate child, and her father 
                traveled around the world, causing Sarah to live with her mother and rarely see her father. At 
                the age of fifteen and a half, Sarah and her mother were not getting along, and it was proposed 
                that she enter the theatre because she had completed her studies, but was unable to start a career 
                as most women during that time did not work. Verneuil states in his biography of Bernhardt 
                that “[i]n order to get away from her mother, whose life as a kept woman shocked her, Sarah 
                replied [to the proposition of becoming an actress]: “All right, let us try.” It is hard to believe that 
                this is exactly how was decided the career of a woman who was destined to become the greatest 
                artist in the world.” 
                .</p>

            <p><h2>Rise to Fame</h2></p>
            <p>Her career in the theatre began in October 1860, when she auditioned for the 
                Conservatoire in France. Her inexperience was made evident when, at her audition, she was 
                unaware that she needed to bring a scene partner, so she quickly decided that she would recite a 
                fable. At first, the directors were shocked and considered it a joke, but Sarah’s personality 
                showed through performance and she was among the fifteen to twenty who were accepted into the Conservatoire.  Thus, began the sparkling career of Sarah Bernhardt
                </p>
                <p>Sarah Bernhardt’s career was able to flourish, because in 1870 more roles were available for women. Gail Finney states in the introduction of her book on women in modern drama that “the reasons for this sudden flowering of stage heroines can be found in the immense upheavals in the condition of women at the turn of the century, changes by which no dramatist of the day could remain unaffected.”  As mentioned before, women often led boring lives. They were unable to work and spent their time making sure the servants completed their tasks and their husbands were happy. The fact that women were starting to make a place for themselves in society allowed for Sarah Bernhardt to pave her own path and start a career in a profession that had been looked down upon for centuries before.</p>
                <p>
                    <p><h2> Sarah Burnhardt's Work</h2></p>
                    Sarah spent fifty-one years in the theatre, working from 1862 to 1913 in such theatres as 
the Odéon, the Comédie Française, and touring in Europe and the Americas.  Her success is 
evident in her autobiography, My Double Life, in which she stated, “We left Chicago to go to 
Saint Louis, which we reached after travelling two hundred eighty-three miles in fourteen hours. 
In my drawing room on the train Abbey and Jarrett showed me the grand total for the sixty-two 
performances since we had left France: 227,459 dollars – i.e. 1,37,284 francs – an average of 
18,343 francs for each performance.”  Sarah Bernhardt had not only changed European 
society’s view on the actress, but had also made a strikingly notable career for herself out of the 
profession. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to give Sarah Bernhardt the credit of putting a new face on the career of acting 
for women, it is important to look at what made her such a distinctive actress and relate that to 
the changes she created. In the preface of her memoir, Victoria Larson commends the work of 
Bernhardt and calls her style of acting “a blend of romantic passion combined with academic 
technique, dedicated often to the presentation of dying heroines in plays by conventional 
dramatist. . . .” Bernhardt’s passion can be attributed to her success. Larson adds that “Sarah 
had a powerfully charismatic stage presence that overrode the boundaries of time and makes her 
memory live: in Sarah’s case it seems to have been a compound of her remarkable and beautiful 
voice and crystalline intonation, her ability to represent and induce intense emotion, and her 
physical grace.”  Her passion and grace can be seen in her performance in the 1912 silent film ‘Queen Elizabeth.’ In this performance, Bernhardt used over-exaggerated movements and dramatic faces—a type of acting that would captivate any viewer.  Bernhardt’s style of acting and the passion she put into each performance, as mentioned before, can be attributed as causing her success. This success is what led to the change in society’s viewpoint towards actresses.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1923, the year of her death, Bernhardt wrote what can be called an “instruction 
manual” for the actor. The Art of Theatre covers everything from the physical qualities to the  
moral qualities needed by the actor, and ends with how to deal with the criticisms of audiences 
and a reflection on the memories of her career. The fact that Sarah Bernhardt, an actress, 
published a book in which she instructs the reader on what is deemed necessary for an actor and 
ends with her own reflections on her career, shows that she had conquered society’s centuries old 
condescending outlook on actresses. She made being an actress a respectable job in European 
society and paved the way for future actresses.  

                </p>

                <p><h2>Commending Sarah's Work</h2></p>
                <p>
                    James Agate, a friend of Bernhardt, recalled a memory he had of Bernhardt when she was teaching a class at her theatre in Paris. He stated, “The pupils, nearly all young girls, though here and there an actress with a foot on a lower rung of the professional ladder, sat round the back of the stage in a semicircle. There was something of the whispering hush of an excited congregation. And then Sarah appeared.”  Agate also quoted Maurice Baring, “For Bernhardt’s art, Mr. Baring tells us, was a complex whole made up of rhythmical movement, gesture, look, speech, hands, hair, body and spirit.”  These two quotations serve as evidence to the fact that Sarah Bernhardt defied European society’s views on actresses in two ways: one way being the fact that she was revered and respected not only by her pupils, but also by important men of the time. The second way is the fact that a female was teaching a group of young females the art of acting, as Agate recalled in his anecdote found in his preface. Centuries prior this would have been unheard of. Being an actress was finally seen as a respectable job in society.  
                </p>

    <p><h2>Summary</h2></p>   
    <p>
        he late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a major increase in the number of actresses. The published censuses of England and Wales showed that there were approximately three-hundred and thirty-three female actors in 1841. In 1871, when there was said to have been an increase in the number of roles available to women and when Sarah Bernhardt began working, there were approximately one-thousand six hundred and ninety-three female actors. By the time Bernhardt had made a notable profession out of acting and two years before her death, there were 
approximately three-thousand six hundred and ninety-six female actors.  Just the increase in the number of actresses during the Victorian Era proves the advances women had made in the career of acting and their position in European society, many of which were due to Bernhardt.  	</p>   <p>	Over the centuries, actresses have overcome many hurdles to achieve a respectable place in society. The profession for women evolved over the centuries to a respectable one. By 1870, more roles were available to women. However, Sarah Bernhardt’s fame and notoriety can be seen as what allowed the profession of acting for women to achieve complete respectability in European society.
